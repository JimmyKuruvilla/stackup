<h2>What is it?</h2>
<div class="indent">
StackUp allows you register an emailaddress, and recive daily emails with questions the StackUp team has decided are suitable for newer developers. The questions are selected based on data provided by the Stack Overflow API and attempt to guarantee the following:
<ol>
  <li>Each question must be appropriate to a new developer's level of knowledge</li>
  <li>Each question must not have been answered at the time the daily email is sent</li>
  <li>While possible each user must recieve a unique question from each other user so that users of StackUp don't canibalize their own opportunities to answer questions</li>
  <li>While possible each user must only recieve questions they have not previously been sent</li>

</ol>

<h2>Why build it?</h2>
<div class="indent">
  This project was started because it seemed like an interesting idea, and because it seemed like it would have practical applications during our final weeks at The Flatiron School. 
</div>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<div class="indent">
StackUp is powered by an algorithm that tries to differentiate between "easy" and "hard" questions based on the tags appended to a question, the overall length of a question, and the proportion of a question that consists of code. The algorithm is based on the following assumptions:
<ul>
<li>Questions with a single, general tag (e.g., "Ruby") are easier than questions with multiple, specific tags (e.g., "Ruby", "Ruby on Rails", "SQL", "JavaScript")</li>
<li>Short questions are easier than long questions</li>
<li>Questions with little code are easier than questions with lots of code</li>
</ul>
These assumptions, of course, do not always hold. Long questions with multiple tags and extensive code snippets may be resolved by a single line of code, while brief, codeless questions may harbor abstruse questions on language design. Still, the algorithm has been relatively effective at identifying the small number of "easy" questions available on Stack Overflow at any given time. In the future, the StackUp team hopes to train a classifier algorithm with labeled examples to improve StackUp's ability to deliver questions calibrated to a user's preferred level of difficulty.


StackUp is hosted on Heroku, Ruby on Rails powers the server side, JQuery is helping streamline the client side interactions, and GitHub's omniauth service is used for user authentication and registration.

<h2>Who made it?</h2>
<div class="indent">
StackUp is a project built by three students at The Flatiron School's web immersive course in NYC, NY. It's goal is to allow newer developers to streamline one part of the process of building an online presence with Stack Overflow. 
</div>

<h2>Why can't I select questions other than Ruby/Rails?</h2>
<div class="indent">
It would be great to be able to send users customized question sets. However the way Stack Overflow allows users to tag questions meant that tags were not always useful in determining content or difficulty. In the interests of time and creating something of use to us, this feature was shelved in favor of completing the rest of the project.
